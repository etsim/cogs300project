# cogs300project
This project was based on teaching a robot how to play a game, using a reinforcement based learning. We let the robot play against it self to learn. 

THE GAME:
A two player game, where each opponent is trying to bring back as many balls to their respective base.
Each player has the ability to shoot a laser and stun the opponent, freezing them for a small amount of time.
Each player can also steal another ball from the players base.


OUR STRATEGY:
Focused on efficiency; 
- Bringing back a maximum of 2 balls, to not be slow. 
- Grabbing balls that are nearest to us.
- Hunt enemy if they have more balls than us and we are loosing.
- End game strategy: get rid of targets in other players base.


REWARDS:
For shooting the enemy
- this helped the robot focus on accuracy
Going closer to the Targets
Bringing balls back to your own base
For having a winning score
